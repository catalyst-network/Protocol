## Why Protobuffs

Protocol Buffers are a way of encoding structured data in an efficient yet extensible format.

From Google - https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview

> Protocol buffers have many advantages over XML for serializing
> structured data. Protocol buffers:
> 
> -   are simpler
> -   are 3 to 10 times smaller
> -   are 20 to 100 times faster
> -   are less ambiguous
> -   generate data access classes that are easier to use programmatically
